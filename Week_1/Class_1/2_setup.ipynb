    "* Don't have to worry about local computer issues. You can run your instance on any computer.\n",
    "* Can run code while your computer is off/updating/you want to play fortnite.\n",
    "* If you later want to run more complicated models like Deep Neural Networks you can use this same approach, but with a paid-GPU'd instance if you do not own a powerful enough computer.\n",

    "There are also a few drawbacks:\n",
    "* At the whim of the internet. I would not code on a cloud instance if I was in Antartica, for example.\n",
    "* Free-tier instances have low storage and shoddy hardware. Will not be an issue for our purposes."

Credit must go to Jake VanderPlas for his "Python Data Science Handbook" of which I have used extensively to develop this course.

Additional credit to Andrew Ng for his Coursera specialization [Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)
from whom I got much of the information on logistic regression, as well as [Daniel Robinson](https://sites.google.com/site/danielprobinson/)
for his slides on nonlinear optimization.
